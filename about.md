I'm a Brazilian Electronic Engineering student <a href="https://www.utfpr.edu.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Brazil</a>, pursuing a double degree in Computer Science with a Masters in Internet, Systems, and Security <a href="https://telecomnancy.univ-lorraine.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in France</a>.

I love to learn, explore new Vim keybindings, and challenge myself on <a href="https://www.root-me.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">root-me</a>.

I am particularly interested in Cybersecurity. 👨‍💻

**I will be happy to talk with you, feel free to contact me! ✨**
