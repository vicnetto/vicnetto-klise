"Missionaries and Cannibals" was a game developed for the Programa de Educação Tutorada (PET) at UTFPR in Curitiba, Brazil. The objective of the game is to transport 3 cannibals and 3 missionaries to the other side of the river. However, a rule prohibits leaving a larger number of cannibals than missionaries on either side of the river.

## Technologies Used

The game was implemented using the **C++** programming language, with the **SFML** library utilized for the creation of the graphical interface.
